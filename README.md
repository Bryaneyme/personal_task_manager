(broken) This was my first appplication with a GUI.

Learned:
- GUI development with QT framework: PySide6
- Event handling with signals and slots
- Work with a "designer" (designer was a custom ChatGPT designer). Worked as a "developer", using the designer's values, to style the GUI.
- Separation of concerns: Separate a class object (each Task objects) from an app, and interact with it.
- Error handling

Need to improve on:
- Have a clear idea of the structure of the project BEFORE coding. I've made the mistake of coding as I was thinking about how to implement certain features.
- When editing certain features, other parts of the app were influenced, and I didn't know which ones, because the outcome wasn't clear in my head
- Result: app is broken haha
